🐢 Turtle Race Game (Python)

A fun Python game built using the turtle graphics module where players bet on which turtle will win a race! Each turtle moves forward a random distance until one crosses the finish line.

🎮 How the Game Works

When the program starts, a window opens with 7 turtles, each a different color.

You are prompted to bet on a turtle color.

The race begins once a bet is placed.

Turtles move forward randomly.

The first turtle to cross the finish line wins.

The result is printed in the console:

🎉 You win if your chosen color wins!

❌ You lose if another turtle wins.
